# SPARQL Ontology for ESS Neutron Spectroscopy 🧪🔍  

This repository provides a **Python-based SPARQL tool** for working with an ontology tailored to **neutron spectroscopy** at the **European Spallation Source (ESS)**. It includes sample queries and an RDF setup to facilitate semantic data exploration.

---

## Features ✨  

- **SPARQL Queries**: Perform advanced ontology-based searches.  
- **RDF Ontology**: Structured representation for neutron spectroscopy data.  
- **Python Integration**: Simple scripts to interact with the ontology.  

---

## Prerequisites 🛠️  

- Python 3.8+  
- Required libraries:
  - `rdflib`  

Install dependencies:  
pip install rdflib  

---

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ess-sparql-ontology.git  
   cd ess-sparql-ontology  

2. Install dependencies:  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  

---

## Usage 🔧  

1. Load the RDF ontology:  
   python load_ontology.py  

2. Run SPARQL queries:  
   python run_query.py --query queries/sample_query.rq  

3. Modify `queries/` to add custom SPARQL queries.  

---

## File Structure 📂  

- `ontology/`: RDF files for the neutron spectroscopy ontology.  
- `queries/`: Sample SPARQL queries for testing.  
- `load_ontology.py`: Script to load and inspect the RDF ontology.  
- `run_query.py`: Script to execute SPARQL queries.  
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.  
- `README.md`: Documentation for the repository.  

---

## Example Commands  

- Load the ontology:  
  python load_ontology.py  

- Run a sample query:  
  python run_query.py --query queries/sample_query.rq
